    Portable LCD(Liquid Crystal Display)
        Backlight shines through liquid crystals, color filters, and other components
        Advantages
            Lightweight
            Low power
            Inexpensive
        Disadvantages
            Black levels are a challenge because of the backlight shining through
            Tough to match colors
            Requires a separate backlight which can be difficult to replace
                Fluorescent, LED, etc.
    OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)
        Organic compound emits light when receiving an electrical current
        Thinner and lighter
        Flexible and mobile
        No glass needed
        No backlight, great color representation
        Not quite ready for laptops
            Organic material degrade over time
            Decayed images can remain on the screen
            More costly and uses more power than LCD
    Multiple antennas inside the screen
        WiFi main and auxiliary
        Bluetooth
        Wrap around the screen to the top so they will be at the highest point
    Laptop Webcam
        Video capture
            Built-in camera and microphone
        Usually includes both audio and video
        Needs the correct drivers installed depending on the operating system 
    Microphone
        Built-in, useful for video calls
        Not good for non-casual use
            Analog/USB external microphone can help

    Backlighting
        LED Backlight
            Around the edge of the screen or an array of LEDS behind the screen
            Uses DC voltage so it doesnâ€™t have to do any power conversions
            The latest laptops usually have LED backlights
        CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp)
            Higher voltage and power needed to run
            Thicker, making for a thicker screen
            Not very common anymore, seen on older laptops
            May have an inverter to convert AC to DC
    Digitizer
        Use a pen-like device as input by touching the actual screen
        Used often for graphical input
        Becoming more common on laptops/tablets
    Touchscreen
        Merge laptop and tablet input
        No keyboard required but can be added
        Use your finger to touch and navigate on the screen
