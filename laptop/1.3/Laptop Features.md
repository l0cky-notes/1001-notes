    Laptop keyboards/keys are usually smaller than desktop, thus losing some keys you would normally have access to. However, many of the feature of the laptop are still available through function (fn) keys
        Dual Displays
            The toggle Fn key is added to perform secondary functions found on other keys (like the top row F1-F12)
            Toggle between LCD/external monitor/both
            Fn key can usually be found near the lower left of the keyboard
            Different makes and models of laptops will have different functions assigned to the keys
        LCD Switch
            The ‘refrigerator door’ effect: The laptop can determine which display to use based on whether the screen is closed or open
            Modernt laptops have an internal magnetic switch that will oversee this process
            Older models may have an actual physical switch on the outside of the frame
            Set the functionality in the BIOS or utility
        Wireless Control
