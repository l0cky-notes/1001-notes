Storage
    Desktop: 3.5 in HD
    Laptop: 2.5 in SSD
    SSD: Solid State Drive
        All memory, no moving parts
        Silent, fast access time, no latency
        1.8/2.5 in form factors 
    Hybrid (SSHD): Solid state hybrid drive
    Flash memory and hard drive storage
    SSD caches the information as it’s being written to hard drive data allowing you to write information quickly allowing you to continue working
    Magnetic disk:
        Traditional spinning drive plates
        Tend to have larger capacities than SSD 
    Replacing Storage:
        All internal
        Accessed by removing a cover plate on the back and exposing the internal components of the laptop
        Modular – two screws and the drive slides out 
Memory
    SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module)
    Micro-DIMM (Micro-Dual In-Line Memory Module)
    Usually has two hooks on each side allowing you to pull them out
    When replacing them, make sure the copper contacts are inserted all the way into the slots, takes very little pressure 
Smart card readers
    Many laptops have an integrated card reader built into the laptop
    There are also other external one using USB 
Optical Drive
    Becoming difficult to find
    Often removable
    Read/write CD-RW/CD-ROM and DVD-RW/DVD-ROM in a portable device 
Wireless cards
    Laptops very rarely are connected to the internet through cables
    Can have several different wireless cards
        802.11 wireless connection
        W-WAN – cellular based wireless
        W-PAN – personal area network/bluetooth 
    Wires connect to antennas and will wrap through the laptop and around the top of the LCD display
    Different form factors(sizes)
        Mini PCI (~6cm wide)
        Mini PCI Express (~3cm wide) 
    Install into properly labeled slots and screw in place 
Video Cards
    Usually built into the processor, not upgradeable
    Sometimes part of the system board, not upgradeable
    Some will have upgradable video cards but only in special cases when someone works professionally with video and needs it in mobile form 
Screen
    LCD Display (Liquid Crystal Display)
    Light, high resolution
    Fragile
    Resolutions are fixed, changes may look blurry 
Power Supply
    DC Jack
    May look different depending on the model of laptop
    Many will have an AC to DC converter
    110 volts US-220 volts EU
Batteries
    Lithium Ion(Li-ion)
    Common in consumer electronics
    No “memory effect” meaning you don’t have to deplete the battery before changing
    Each charge diminished its capacity so it will lose its capability over years of use
    Different makes and models use different form factors and connection types 
Touchpad
    Usually under the keyboard
    Will have traditional left/right buttons
    Sometime there will also be a pointing stick in the middle of the keyboard you can use to navigate 
Laptop frame
    Plastic
        Lightweight, mobile
        Durable, difficult to break
        Inexpensive, cost-effective 
    Metal
        More durable than plastic
        Can be difficult to repair 
Speakers
    Self-contained inside the frame
    Not the best quality
    Often stereo (L/R), and may include a subwoofer 
System board (motherboard)
    Desktops usually have standard sizes
    Laptops have proprietary board built to fit each model
    Replacement isn’t easy
    Usually swap out the entire board
    Most components are connected the system board 
CPU (central processing unit)
    Designed for mobility
    Use as little power as possible
    Creates as little heat as possible
    Integrated features
        Video and memory controllers are often integrated in 
    Not very upgradeable but can be replaced
        Often slower than desktopSize and heat distribution disadvantages
