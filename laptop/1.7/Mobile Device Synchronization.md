    Synchronizing Your Data
        In our modern technological landscape, we have data spread across many different devices
            Smartphones
            Laptops
            PCs
            Tablets
            Fitness trackers
            Etc.
        All of this data needs to be synchronized across all of these different devices and  be accessible from all of our devices at any time
        The data comes in many forms
            Email
            Contacts
            Calendar
            Applications
            Media
            Passwords
            Bookmarks
        The security to protect this data is also very important. The mobile devices need some way to securely communicate with the servers and the servers need some way of knowing that they are communicating back with our individual devices
    Synchronizing to the cloud
        Completely hands off, there are no physical cables or local files on your device 
        Can be integrated into an existing system you may already use like Gmail, Microsoft exchange, iCloud, etc
        Will provide complete backup and recovery of all of you data
    Synchronizing to your desktop
        Another way to provide backup for all of you data
        You will need to install a backup/synchronization application on you desktop
            These apps take up relatively small space on your harddrive 
            iTunes can be used on Windows and macOS
        You need to have enough disk space to store all the files you want to backup and synchronize, could be many gigabytes in size
        iOS
            Apple iTunes syncs everything on you phone by making a full backup on your laptop/computer
        Android
            Syncs online with google
            Use 3rd party apps to transfer movies and music like doubleTwist
