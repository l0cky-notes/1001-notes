    One of the big connectivity advantages of mobile phones is that they are connected to the internet and this is available through your service provider
        This means you can use the device to connect other devices to the internet as well
    Hotspot
        One common way to do this is by turning your phone into a wireless hotspot
        By turning on the hotspot capabilities, other devices on that 802.11 wireless network are able to connect to the internet
        This functionality is managed by your service provider and carry an additional cost for using the data
    Tethering
        You can also connect to the internet using you laptop with a physical connection using the USB charger provided with your phone or through a bluetooth connection
        This can only be done with a single connection
        This functionality is managed by your service provider and carry an additional cost for using the data
    Airplane mode
        With one button, many different wireless networks can be enabled or disabled on your smartphone
            Cellular
            WiFi
            Bluetooth
            NFC
        Individual features can be re-enabled without enabling cellular features allowing you to connect to the airplanes 802.11 wireless network to access the internet
            iOS – this can be done in settings or by the control center screen that can be accessed by swiping down on the top of the screen
            Android – this can be done many ways, usually in Settings/Wireless & Network Settings
    Bluetooth
        Personal area network (PAN) the works only over a short distance of about 10 meters
        Many kinds of devices can be connected using Bluetooth
            Mouse
            Keyboard
            Speakers
            Headsets
            Automobiles
        Once a connection is established, the devices should automatically connect with each other when they are powered on and in range of one another
        Pairing process is relatively straightforward
            Enable Bluetooth on both devices
            Set devices to discoverable mode (discoverable devices will show up on the screen of your phone)
                Sometimes will require a key or pin sequence to be entered
                All other devices that have been paired with your phone in the past will show up in the list of devices
    Your phone is a radio
        Baseband radio processor

        The radio processor uses a real-time operating system
            Allows you phone to set a priority and be able to connect over the network
        The firmware associated with the baseband radio processor needs to be occasionally updated and is done OTA (Over the Air)

        IMSI
            International Mobile Subscriber Identity

    VPN (Virtual Private Network)
        Turn your phone into a VPN endpoint allowing for a secure channel of communication between your phone and another device
        Usually integrated into the OS so no additional software is needed
        But you can get other software from 3rd parties

            VPN server
            Account name
