    Cable
        Sometimes referred to as broadband 
        Transmits many frequencies and data types over the same wire
        DOCIS (Data Over Cable Interface Specification)
            Standard that is used to send data to cable modems
        High speed networking
            4-25 MB/sec speeds
            GB speeds possible
   		(A)DSL – Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
        Internet supplied through phone networks/companies using existing phone lines
        Download speed is faster than upload speed making it asymmetric 
        10,000 foot limitation from CO
        52 MB/sec downstream/16 MB/sec upstream speeds but possibly faster the closer you are to the CO
    Dial-up
        Uses existing analog telephone lines 
        Not being used much anymore because of slow speed
        56 KB/sec modems, but up to 320 KB/sec with compression
        Difficult to scale 
        May still be used in some legacy equipment and networks 
    Fiber
        Uses fiber optic cable 
        High speed networking with increased bandwidth
        Supports various types of data 
        Enhanced capabilities
            Hundreds of HD channels 
            1 GB/sec speeds
            Cloud storage/DVR enhancements
    Satellite Networking
        Communication with a satellite orbiting the Earth is established, the satellite then communicates back down to a data center and the process reverses to send the communication back to us 
        Relatively high cost to operate compared to other types of connections
        Fast connection
            50 MB/sec upstream/3 MB/sec downstream speeds
        Good for remote sites that are not physically close to a main network 
        High latency 
            250ms delay both ways in communication
        High frequency 
            Operates at 2Ghz
            Can be interrupted by bad weather or other obstacles 
    ISDN – Integrated Services Digital Network
        Older technology but still has some limited use
        Two versions
            BRI (Basic Rate Interface)
                2B + D
                2 bearer channels – sends data, 64 KB/sec
                1 signaling channel – manages connection, 16 KB/sec
            PRI (Primary Rate Interface)
                Larger scale of BRI delivered over T1/E1
                T1: 23B + D
                E1: 30B + D + alarm channel
        Commonly used for voice channels PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network aka phone company) connecting to PBX (Private Branch Exchange, private phone network)
        Modern upgrade to ISDN is VOIP (Voice Over IP)
    Cellular Network
        Connect to the internet through your mobile devices 
        Tethering with a charging wire can connect other devices like a laptop to the internet through your cellular connection 
            Can be done wirelessly as well with 802.11 wireless networking turning your phone into a “mobile hotspot”
    Line-of-sight Services
        Wireless internet service that you can connect to using a modem that picks up a signal from a nearby antenna transmitting a wireless signal 
        Common in metropolitan areas
        Need to actually be able to see the antenna so the wireless signal is uninterrupted as it travels to you
        High frequency operation
        Has a lower frequency/non line-of-sight option that operates at a slower speed
        WiMAX(Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)
