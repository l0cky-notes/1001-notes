    Cellular Networks
        Mobile devices are called cell phones because of how cell towers are laid out geographically
        Antennas are placed at the corners of land areas that are divided into cells to cover specific frequencies

    2G Networks
        Two camps of 2G technology
            GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication)
            CDMA (Code Division Mobile Access)
        Built mainly for phone calls and voice communication
        Some minor upgrades were made for packet switching (data transfer) but the network was not designed to handle data 
    3G Networks
        Introduced in 1998
        Upgraded connectivity over 2G and improved speeds up to several MB/sec
        Bandwidth improvement allowed for more functionality 
            GPS systems
            Video
            More data transfer
    4G Networks
        LTE (Long Term Evolution)
        Converged GSM/CDMA providers
        Based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)
        Upgrades to data handling over 3G
            Download rates of 150 MB/s
        LTE-A (LTE Advanced)
            Download rates of 300 MB/sec
    5G Networks
        Started rollouts in 2018/2019, planned to be worldwide in 2020 but that did not happen 
        Significant performance improvement because 5G operates at higher frequencies than 4G
