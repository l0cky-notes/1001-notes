	802.11 networking is the standard used in wireless networks and there are many types and updates that have been introduced since its release
        Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802)
        New standards are coming out relatively frequently
        The Wifi trademark indicated that a device is 802.11 wireless compatible and should be able to connect and interact with other devices that meet this standard
        In order to gain this distinction, devices have to go through interoperability testing
    802.11a
        Released Oct. 1999
        Operates in 5GHz range
            Can operate in other ranges with special licensing
        54 mb/sec speed
        Generally ⅓ the range of other standards introduced around the same time (802.11b) because higher frequencies get absorbed by big objects such as buildings
        Not commonly used anymore
    802.11b
        Release Oct. 1999
        Operates in 2.4 GHz range
        11 mb/sec speed
        Better range than 802.11a because of lower frequency operation
        Tends to be frequency conflict because other devices use these same frequencies
            Baby monitors
            Microwaves
            Cordless phones
    802.11g
        Released June 2003
        Operates in 2.4 GHz range
        54 mb/sec speed
        Update to 802.11b but still backwards compatible 
        Same frequency conflicts as 802.11b

    802.11n
        Released Oct. 2009
        Update to all previous versions
        Operates in both 2.4/5 GHz ranges 
            40 MHz channel widths
        MIMO (Multiple input multiple output)
            Ability to send multiple streams of traffic across the same frequency thus increasing the speed and maximum throughput 
        150 mb/sec speed X 4 input channels = 600 mb/sec maximum throughput speed
    802.11ac
        Released Jan. 2014
        Significant improvement over 802.11n
        Operates in 5 GHz range 
            Much larger range of frequencies so it’s less crowded
            Up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth 
            Increased channel bonding
        Denser signal modulation meaning more data can be sent in the same amount of time 
        MU-MIMO (Multi User MIMO)
            Eight separate MIMO streams going to multiple devices on the network at the same time
        Up to 866 mb/sec per stream X 8 inputs = ~7 Gb/sec maximum throughput speeds
