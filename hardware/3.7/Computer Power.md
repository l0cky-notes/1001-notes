**warning**
always disconnect from power source when working on a device
always,seriously

some devices store a chare in capacitors
know how to discharge before touching
never connect your body to any part of an electrial system
do not connect yourself to an electrical ground
respect electricity
it does not respect you

**computer power supply          (converts AC to DC)**
computer use DC voltage
most power sources provide AC voltage
convert 115 V AC or 220 V AC
to 3.3 V DC, 5.5 V DC, and 12 V DC
you'll know when this isn't working
An important component

**AMP and volt**
Ampere (amp, A) - the rate of electron flow past a point in one second
the diameter or the hose
voltage (volt, V) electrical "pressure" pushing the electrons
how open the faucet is
**power**
Watt(W) - measurement of real power use
volts * amps = watts
120V * 0.5A = 60W
**Currect**
Aternating currect (AC)
direction of current constantly reverses
distributes electricity effiviently over long distances
frequency of this cycle is important
US/Canada - 110 to 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 hertz(Hz)
Europe 220-240 VAC, 50Hz

Direct currect (DC)
currect moves in one direction with a constant voltage
**Dual-voltage input options**
voltage varies by country
us/canada - 110 to 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 herts(Hz)
europe - 220 -240 VAC, 50 Hz
manually switch between 100 V/115 V and 220V/230V
get your meter
or use an auto-switching power supply
don't plug a 115V power supply into a 230V power source

**24-pin motherboard power**
main mobo power
provides +3.3V,+/-5V, and +/-12v
20 pin connector was the original ATX standard
24 pin was added for PCI Express power
you can connect a 24-pin connector to a 20-pin motherboard
some cable are 20-pin + 4-pin

**power supply output**
different voltage
for different components
postive and negative volts
voltage is a different is a common reference point
depends on where you measure form
at the front door of your house
the second floor is +10feet
the basement is -10feet
**power supply output**
+12V
PCIe adapters, hard drive motors, cooling fans, most modern components
+5V
some motherboard components
many components are now using +3.3V
+3.3V
m.2 slots, RAM slots, Mobo logic circuits
-12V
integrated LAN
older serial port
some PCI cards
-5V
available for ISA adapter card
most cards didn't use it
today's mobo don't have ISA slots

**sizing a power supply**
Power supplies are rated by watts
overall and by individual voltages
bigger isn't necessarilly better
more expensive doesn't speed up your computer
physical size is relatively standard
older case and systems may have proprietary sizes
calculate the watts requires for all components
CPU, storage devices, video adapter
many online calculators
video adapter are usually the largest power draw
many video card spec list a recommended power supply wattage
50% cap is a good rule of thumb
power supply runs efficiently and there's room to grow
