OPTICAL FIBER COMMUNICATION
transmision by light
    the visible spectrum
    
no RF signal
    very difficult to monitor or tap
       
signal slow to degrade 
    transmission over long distances
    
immune to radio or electrical interference
    there's no RF

MUTLIMODE FIBER 

	short-range communication
		2 kilometers for 100 Mbit/s
		550 meter for 10 gbit/s
		
	inexpensive kight source
		i.e, lED


single-mode fiber
	long-range communication
		over 80km without additional processing
		
	expensive loght soucre 
		laser beams
