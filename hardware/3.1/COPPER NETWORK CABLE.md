THE IMPORTANCE CABLE
• Fundamental to network communication
- Incredibly important foundation

• Usually only get one good opportunity at
building your cabling infrastructure
- Make it good!

• The vast majority of wireless communication uses cables
- Unless you're an amateur radio operator


TWISTED PAIR COPPER CALING

• Balanced pair operation
- Two wires with equal and opposite signals
- Transmit+, Transmit- / Receive+, Receive-

• The twist is the secret!
- Keeps a single wire constantly moving
away from the interference
- The opposite signals are compared on the other end

• Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates


NETWORK CABLING STANDARDS
Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA)
- Alliance of trade associations, develops standards for the industry
- Standards start with RS-# (Recommended Standard) or EIA-#
- http://www.eia.org

• Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
- Standards, market analysis, trade shows,
government affairs, etc.
- ANSI/TIA/EIA-568 - Commercial Building
Telecommunications Cabling Standard
- http://www.tiaonline.org

• International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
- Defines classes of networking standards

PLENUM-RATED CABLE

• Traditional cable jacket
- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

• Fire-rated cable jacket
- Fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or
low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

• Plenum-rated cable may not be as flexible
- May not have the same bend radius

• Worst-case planning
- Important concerns for any structure

UNSHIELDED AND SHIELDED CABLE 

• UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
- No additional shielding
- The most common twisted pair cabling

• STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
- Additional shielding protects against interference
• Shield each pair and/or the overall cable
- Requires the cable to be grounded

• Abbreviations
- U = Unshielded
- S = Braided shielding
- F = Foil shielding

• (Overall cable) / (individual pairs)TP
- Braided shielding around the entire cable
and foil around the pairs is S/FTP
• Foil around the cable and no shielding
around the pairs is F/UTP


T568a AND T568b TERMINATION

• Pin assignments from EIA/TIA-568-B standard
- Eight conductor 100-ohm balanced
twisted-pair cabling

• T568A and T568B are different pin assignments
for 8P8C connectors
- Assigns the T568A pin-out to horizontal cabling

• Many organizations traditionally use 568B
- Difficult to change in mid-stream

• You can't terminate one side of the cable
with 568A and the other with 568B
- You'll run into problems

COAXIAL CABLE

•Two or more forms share a common axis

•RG-6 used in television/digital cable
-And high speed internet over cable

•RG-59 used as patch cables
-not used for long distances
