**printer ribbon replacement**
single ribbon
	self-contained
	one long circle 
replace when ink becomes too light
	ink is eventually consumed
designed to be modular
	replace in less thab a minute

**print head replacement**
takes a lot of abuse 
	directly hits the ribbon and paper
gets hot
	watch your fingers
another modular part
	look for a release lever or bar

**replacing paper**
not as easy as a laer printer
	paper must feed perfectly into holes
		tractor feed
forms must be positioned correctly
	text need to fit a predefined space
paper must feed without constraint
	make sure nothing is in the way
