Blu-ray Disc Recordable (BD-R)

Blu-ray Disc Recordable Erasable (BD-RE)

Solid-state drive(ssd)

non-volatile memory

no moving parts

very fast performance

no spinning drive delays

2.5 sata inface

m.2 interface

smaller storage device

as fast (or faster) than sata

no SATA data or power cables

PCI express bus connection

4 GByte/second throughput or faster

different connector type

need to be compatible with the slot key/spacer

B key, M key, or B and M key

some m.2 drives will support both

B-key and M-key

B key

PCIe x2

M key

PCIe x 4

Hard drives

non-volatile magnetic storage

rapidly rotating platters

random-access

retreve data from any part of the drive at any time

moving parts

spinning platters, moving actuator arm

mechanical components limit the access speed

mechanical components can also break

3.5 format

hybrid drive

Solid State Hybrid Drive (SSHD)

both a spinning drive and ssd in a single devices

SSD caches the slower spinning hard drive data

increases speed without the cost of an SSD-only system

look like a normal hard drive or SSD

same form factor

USB flash drive

flash memory

EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)
   no-volatile memory

no power to retain data

limited number of writes

can still read the data

not designed for archival storage

easy to lose or damage

always have a backup
