**BIOS** - Basic Input/Output System
the software used to start your computer
 the firmware
 system, BOIS, ROM BIOS
 ROM or flash memory
initilized CPU and memory
 build the workspace
 POST
  Power-On Self-Test
 look for a boot loader
  start the OS
  
**Legacy BIOS**
  the original / traditional BIOS
   It's been around for more than 25 years
  older os talked to hardware through the BIOS
   insted of accessing hardware directly
  limited hardware support
   no drivers for modern network,video,and storage devices
   
**UEFI BOIS**
unified extensible firmware interface 
 based on Intel EFI (extensible firmware interface )
 
A defined standard
 implemented bu the manufactures
 
Designed to replace the legacy BIOS
 need a modern bios for modern computers
 graphical and text-based
 
 **UEFI advantages**
 boot from large(> 2.2 tb) guid partition table (GPT) disk
   also supports FAT and removable media
   
 includes a pre-boot environment
  this isn't an os
  has it own shell,drives, and app
  browse the internet, backup a storage drive
  remote diagnostics, even without an OS
  
  **Nonvolatile bios memory**
store the BIOS configuration
 your settings
 
Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
 a type of memory
 may be backed up with a battery
usually flash memory these days 
 easily stored and accessed
 
 **The "CMOS" battery**
 not needed for today's flash-based storage
  maintains odler BIOS configuration
  may only be used to maintain date/time
A bad battery will require a BIOS confuration or date/time configuration on every boot
on older system, can reset the BIOS configuration by removing the battery 
 newer computer use a jumper
