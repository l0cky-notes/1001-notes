**case fans**
cool air is pulled through a pc
	always check for good airflow
mobo layout becomes imporant
component location is key
	devices, wiring, power
many different sizes and styles
	and volume levels
**on-board fans**
designed to cool an entire adapter card
can be bulky
	may take add adapter card space
usually seen on high-end gpu
**fan specs**
standard size
 I.E, 80mm, 120mm, 200mm
different speeds
 variable speeds
different noise levels 
	not all fans sounds the same
	
**heat sink**
dissipate heat through thermal conduction
	copperor alumunum alloy
fins/grid increase surfface area
	heat is then transferred to the cooler air
thermal paste creates a good contact between the chip and the heat sink
**fanless**
no fans no noise
 slient
specialized fuctions
	video servers, tv set top box, staellite receicer, media server
functions are very controlled 
	carefully measured thermal tests
low power components
	heat sinks
	
**liquid cooling**
coolant is circulated through a computer
	not a new concept
		automibiles, mainframe computers
high-end system
gaming, graphics 
overclocking
