**A computer bus**

communication path

a city of technology

internal PC growth

independent pathways

system expansion

additional capabilities

\*\*The expansion bus \*\*

"width" in bits

big roads, little roads

width is changing to bandwidth

clock speed of the bus

the expansion bus gets its own clock

1 MHz (megahertz) = 1 million cycles per second

1 GHz = 1000 MHz = 1 billion cycles per second

clock speed does not necessarily equal transfer rate

DDR3 SDRAM can transfer 64 times the memory clock speed

**conventional PCI**

peripheral component interconnect

nobody ever calls it that

created in 1994

A common expansion interface

32-bit and 64-bit bus width

parallel communication

throughput varies by bus version

133 MB/s (32-bit at 33 MHz)

266 MB/s ( 32-bit at 66 MHz or 64-bit at 33MHz)

533  MB/s (64-bit at 66 MHz)

**PCI express**

also know as PCIe

replaced PCI, PCI-X, and AGP (accelerated Graphics Port)

communication serially

unidirectional serial "lanes"

slower devices don't slow down everyone

one.two, four,eight, sixteen, or thirty-two full-duplex lanes

x1,x2,x4,x8,x16,x32

"x" is pronounced "by"("by 4", "by 16")

PCI express serial communication

**PCI express throughput**

 different version of PCIe

 improvement in speed with each iteration

per-lane throughput in each direction

 v1.x: 250 MB/s

 v2.x: 500 MB/s

 v3.0: ~1 GB/s 

 v4.0: ~2 GB/s 

 v5.0 (expected in 2019): ~ 4 GB/s
