**cpu cores**
dual-core/ quad-cire/ octa-core / multi-core
	and more all the time 
multi cores
	each core has its own cache
	 the entire chip may have to sharced cache

**CPU cache**
super fast memory
	there's not much of it\
	hold data, instruction, and/or results
level 1 cache
	first check
level 2 cahe 
 secondary data
level 3 chahe
	still on the chip 
	these days
**virtualization support**
run other os within a single hardware platform
	 multi os share a physical hardware components
virtualization in software was limited
	prformance and hardware management challenges
virtualiztion add to the cpu
	hardware is faster and easier to manage
	Intel Virtualization Technology (VT)
	AMD vritualization (AMD-V)
	
**hyper-threading**
hyper-threading technology (HTT)
one cpu, act like two
doesn't actually work as fast as two
	15% to 30% performance inporovement
os must be written for HTT 
	windows xp and later (any modern OS)

**CPU speed**
real speed: CPU clock
	historical qualification of speed
	MHz or GHz
actual speed
	combination of different factors
		clock speed, CPU architecture,bus speed, bus width, L1 cahe speed, L2 cache size, os capabilities

cpu manufacture have moved away from marketing performance in clock cycles

no broadly accepted measure of performance
	use a benchmark that works for you
	
**Overclocking**
when fast isn't fast enough
	increase the clock speed past the rated value
A balancing act
	more power required
	more heat created
	at some point, the system becomes unstable
change the base clock (BCLK)
	need an unlocked CPU
	run a stress test to confirm the stability
this will void your warranty
	you can break more than your CPU
	
**Integrated GPU**
graphics processing unit
	part of the video adapter, mobo or CPU
graphocs rendering requires a lot of work
	dedicted hardware speeds the process
	
**Intel and AMD**
Two solid CPU manufactures
	the differences are subtle
Cost
 AMD is normal less expensive
LAptops
	intel has a large portfolio of options
